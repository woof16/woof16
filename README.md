Hiya! 👋

My name is Alberto. I am a 🇪🇸 Spanish Language Data Analyst currently studying JavaScript on my free time.
I also love Japan 🇯🇵 and videogames. I hope to make one or two in the future with my friend /Ryuu22, who is selflessly guiding me through this lengthy journey.

じゃあ、thanks for stopping by!
